# Webpack 5 configuration

This module aims to teach the basic elementary configuration to create an application with react and typescript.

# Features

- Webpack configuration
- Development server configuration
- Setting up an environment with typescript
- Rules for styles, javascript and typescript
- Creation of hashes
- Plugin for html

# Running the app

I use yarn as my package manager, feel free to change it to whatever manager you use.

If you use *npm* just change the word `yarn` to `npm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBarcenas/react-workshops.git
cd react-workshops/webpack5-configuration

yarn install
```

## Development
`yarn start` starts the application in development mode with active code reloading, bug reports, and more.

## Build
`yarn build` creates an optimized production build of your application.
