# Running the app

I use yarn as my package manager, feel free to change it to whatever manager you use. \
If you use *npm* just change the word `yarn` to `npm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBarcenas/front-end-workshops.git
cd front-end-workshops/webpack-starter-kit
yarn install
```

## Development
`yarn start` starts the application in development mode with active code reloading, bug reports, and more.

## Build
`yarn build` creates an optimized production build of your application.
